Column charts are by nature very simple. They represent a small amount of data in a clear, concise manner. But they can be eminently useful. No matter what kind of data you have, there’s a good chance that a well-crafted column chart will share that information effectively with your audience.

#1.	Column Bar Graphs
The simplest and and most straightforward way to compare various categories is often the classic column-based bar graph. The universally-recognized graph features a series of bars of varying lengths.
One axis of a bar graph features the categories being compared, while the other axis represents the value of each. The length of each bar is proportionate to the value it represents.
Bar graphs work great for visually presenting nearly any type of data.

#2.	Spider Charts
When a statistician needs to visually compare three or more quantitative variables, he or she might choose to use a radar chart, also known as a spider or star chart. The chart usually consists of a series of radii, each representing a different category, that splay out from a center point like spokes.
The length of each “spoke” is proportionate to the value being compared. For each category, the spokes are then connected with a line of a designated pattern or color, forming a star-like shape with points equal to the number of categories.

#3.	Stacked Bar Chart
This should be used to compare many different items and show the composition of each item being compared.
